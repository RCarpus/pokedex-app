# Simple Pokedex App

## Description
This app fetches data from the pokeAPI [https://pokeapi.co/](https://pokeapi.co/) and displays a list of Pokemon that have been fetched. When the name of a pokemon is clicked, some additional details for the pokemon, including height, type, and a picture will be fetched from the API and displayed in a modal on the screen. The user can navigate back and forth through the different pokemon using the left and right arrow keys on a keyboard. The modal can be exited by pressing escape, clicking outside the model box, or clicking the close button on the modal.

## How to run
Download the files a a zip folder, unzip the folder, and open the index.html file using your preferred browser.

## Browser support
This app has been tested on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, and is assumed to work on all other modern browsers. The keypress events do NOT function in IE11, but the basic functionally of the page still works.
